#I've joined the #JavaScript30 Challenge.

Holidays are both awesome and not, both for apparently the same reason - abundance of free time. In order to kill my time before the next semester begins in 16 days, I have decided to join the JavaScript30 challenge, which by its name seems to challenge people undertaking the same to complete the course in 30 days. I can safely assume that this was suggested keeping people's other commitments in mind. But because I have nothing else to do apart from sitting at my desk all day for the net 14 days, I will try to make this challenge intersting and will try to complete this in 10 days.
This repository records my progress through the challenge.

If you have any suggestons, feel free to open an issue. :bowtie:

_P.S: This is neither to undermine anybody's efforts that went into making this challenge nor to suggest in any way that I am too competent for this course. This is just a fun way I came up with to keep myself occupied._
